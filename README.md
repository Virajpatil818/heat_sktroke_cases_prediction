#### Abstract:
The Heatstroke Predictor app utilizes machine learning algorithms and historical weather data to estimate the impact of heatwaves on Pune's population. By analyzing meteorological attributes like temperature, humidity, dew point, and wind speed, the app aims to predict heatstroke cases and enable proactive mitigation strategies.

### How to Use:
1. **Installation:**
   - Clone the repository to your local machine:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/heatstroke-predictor.git
     ```
   - Install dependencies:
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

2. **Usage:**
   - Run the app:
     ```
     python app.py
     ```
   - Input weather data for prediction.

3. **Results:**
   - View predicted heatstroke cases. 

### Features:
- **Data Collection:** Utilizes historical weather data (2016-2020) and synthetic heatstroke cases.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms:** Implements Random Forest Regression, CatBoost Regressor, and XGBoost Algorithm for prediction. [Link to Algorithms](https://github.com/Virajpatil818/Machine-Learning-Algorithms/tree/main/ML%20Algorithms)
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Evaluates model performance using RMSE, R-squared score, and accuracy.
- **Interactive Interface:** User-friendly interface for inputting weather data and viewing predictions.
